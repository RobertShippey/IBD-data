The map shows toilets that the public can use including those in shops, cafes etc if they choose to let non-customers use their loo, such as those in Community Toilet Schemes. They try not to include those that are for customer use only.

The data comes from councils, businesses, the OpenStreetMap project and you! The data will be available for others to use under an open licence. Please help by adding and editing toilets.
